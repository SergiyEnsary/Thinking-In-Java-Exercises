/*Chapter 3
 * Exercise 10:    (5) A vampire number has an even number of digits and is formed by multiplying a pair of numbers
 *	containing half the number of digits of the result. The digits are taken from the original number in any order.
 *	Pairs of trailing zeroes are not allowed. Examples include:
 *	1260 = 21 * 60
 *	1827 = 21 * 87
 *	2187 = 27 * 81
 *	Write a program that finds all the 4-digit vampire numbers. (Suggested by Dan Forhan.)
