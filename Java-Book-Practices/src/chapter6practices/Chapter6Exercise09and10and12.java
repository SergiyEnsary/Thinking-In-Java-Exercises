 * Exercise 9: (2) Create a class called Root that contains an instance of each of the classes
 *				(that you also create) named Component1, Component2, and Component3. Derive a
 *				class Stem from Root that also contains an instance of each “component.” All classes should
 *				have default constructors that print a message about that class.
 *Exercise 10: (1) Modify the previous exercise so that each class only has non-default
 *				constructors.
 *Exercise 12: (3) Add a proper hierarchy of dispose( ) methods to all the classes in
 *				Exercise 9.
